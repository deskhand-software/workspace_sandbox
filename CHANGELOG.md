## [0.1.5] - 2025-11-24

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Unified API:** Replaced multiple execution methods (`run`, `exec`, `start`, `spawn`) with a single, ergonomic `exec(Object command)` and `execStream(Object command)` interface.
  - Shell commands are now run as `ws.exec('ls -la')`.
  - Direct (binary) execution is now `ws.exec(['git', 'status'])`.
  - All streaming/background process APIs use `execStream`.
- **Filesystem API Refactored:** All file/directory operations now accessed via `ws.fs.*` (e.g., `ws.fs.writeFile(...)`).
- **Removed:** Methods `run`, `exec`, `start`, `spawn`, `writeFile`, `readFile`, `createDir`, `tree`, etc, from `Workspace`. See README for migration.

### Fixed

- **Security/Bug:** Path traversal vulnerability in `PathSecurity.resolve` fixed (prevents `../../../etc`).
- **Type Safety:** `WorkspaceProcess` now always exposes the `pid` field. No more dynamic casting required.

### Changed

- Minimalist, intuitive developer experience. See new unified interface and usage in updated README and examples.
- All core examples and tests migrated to modern facade.
- Zero runtime API confusion. All parameters named, all operations discoverable via `Workspace` or `ws.fs`.
- **Dependencies:** Moved `http` package from `dependencies` to `dev_dependencies` (only used in tests).

### Added

- Expanded examples with all main combinations of the new API (shell, binary, streaming, persistent, ephemeral, filesystem, security).
- Pub score expected: 160/160.

### Migration Guide

- `ws.run(...)` ⟶ `ws.exec(...)`
- `ws.writeFile(...)` ⟶ `ws.fs.writeFile(...)`
- `ws.tree()` ⟶ `ws.fs.tree()`
- Etc. See README or run `dart doc workspace_sandbox`.

## [0.1.4] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed

- **Critical:** Fixed binary detection when used as pub dependency in Flutter/Dart projects
- Launcher now correctly resolves package location using `.dart_tool/package_config.json`
- Binary path resolution works seamlessly in all installation contexts (pub.dev, git, path)

### Changed

- Simplified binary detection to 3 essential strategies:
  1. Package cache via `package_config.json` (production installations)
  2. Development build (`native/target/release/`)
  3. Project bin directory (direct path dependencies)
- Removed redundant detection methods for cleaner error messages
- Enhanced error reporting with comprehensive searched paths list

### Technical Details

The launcher now parses `.dart_tool/package_config.json` to reliably locate the package root in pub cache, eliminating the "binary not found" error when installing from pub.dev.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-11-23
### Fixed

- **Critical:** Fix `.pubignore` excluding `lib/src/native/` directory (caused 80/160 pub points)

- Update README.md with correct platform support information

- Correct sandboxing documentation (Job Objects vs AppContainer on Windows)

- Update build instructions for Rust binaries

- Add reactive event system documentation

---

## [0.1.2] - 2025-11-23 

> **⚠️ WARNING:** This version has a packaging error that excludes `lib/src/native/` due to incorrect `.pubignore` configuration. The package cannot be analyzed correctly by pub.dev (80/160 points). **Please use 0.1.3 or later.**

**Complete Native Architecture Rewrite**
- Migrated from FFI + C++ to **pure Rust** standalone binary
- Native launcher now runs as separate process (`workspace_launcher` binary)
- Communication via serialized CLI arguments instead of FFI calls
- **Rationale:** Better cross-platform compatibility, easier maintenance, eliminated FFI marshalling overhead

**API Compatibility:** No breaking changes for Dart users. All public APIs remain identical.

### Added

- `LauncherService` now spawns native binary with `--id`, `--workspace`, `--sandbox`, `--no-net` flags

**Documentation**
- Complete API documentation (160/160 Pana score)
- All public symbols documented with examples
- Rust code fully commented (Clippy pedantic compliant)

### Fixed

- **Windows:** Job Objects correctly handle child process termination
- **Linux:** Bubblewrap now mounts tool caches for Maven/Gradle/NPM
- **Cross-platform:** UTF-8 decoding with `allowMalformed: true` for non-Unicode output (Windows CP850)
- **Network isolation:** Actually enforced at OS level (not just heuristic blocking)
- **Process streams:** Broadcast controllers allow multiple listeners

### Security

**Enhanced Isolation**
